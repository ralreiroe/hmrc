Stage 1

● shop which only sells apples and oranges
● checkout system which takes a list of items and outputs the total cost
● Apples cost 60p and oranges cost 25p.
● For example: [ Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple ] => £2.05
● To play, modify ShopTillTest (there is no Main)


Step 2: Simple offers

● The shop decides to introduce two new offers
○ buy one, get one free on Apples
○ 3 for the price of 2 on Oranges
● Update your checkout functions accordingly
